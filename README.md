# MindFirst Engine (M1E)

MindFirst Engine (M1E) is a post-identity cognitive interaction framework.
It models only structural communication patterns—recursion, pacing, clarity preference,
tangent behaviour—instead of demographics.

This enables bias-resistant, privacy-safe, adaptive AI behaviour.

## Core Principles
- No demographic inference
- Structural modelling only
- Session-scoped OS-map
- Deterministic preprocessing
- Model-agnostic compatibility

## Purpose
MindFirst exists to improve fairness, clarity, and accessibility in AI systems by
focusing on the user's reasoning structure rather than identity categories.
